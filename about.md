I used the data set "ToothGrowth"
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ToothGrowth.html>
to predict the tooth length of guinea pigs.

### Summary of the ToothGrowth dataset

-   60 observations
-   len: the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth)
    in 60 guinea pigs
-   Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1,
    and 2 mg/day)
-   Two delivery methods: OJ (orange juice), VC (ascorbic acid)
